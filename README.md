# Ledger plugin for age clients

Encrypt/decrypt files by using [age](https://age-encryption.org/v1) and a public/private key stored on a Ledger device. This plugin aims to allow interaction between a Ledger device and an age client like [`age`](https://age-encryption.org) or [`rage`](https://str4d.xyz/rage).

Largely inspired by the [YubiKey plugin](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey/).
